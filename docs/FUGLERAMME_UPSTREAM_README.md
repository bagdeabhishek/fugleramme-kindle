Bird frame for Raspberry Pi - real-time bird detection by audio, fully local AI, rendered as real, hand-cut 1800s bird illustrations. On an e-ink panel, a TV, or any screen.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Fugleramme has been selected for the [GOSIM Spotlight](https://spotlight.gosim.org/shenzhen2026/) at [GOSIM Shenzhen 2026](https://shenzhen2026.gosim.org/). If you're there, come by and say hi!

> [!NOTE]
> Still in early development: expect the odd bug and a few unpolished edges, with plenty more features to come.

Live on **[fugleramme.arnegiacomo.dev](https://fugleramme.arnegiacomo.dev)** running from my kitchen window and displaying the actual birds currently heard in my garden (Bergen, Norway). See other frames from around the world [here](docs/showcase.md)!

Hardware, install and operations docs: **[arnegiacomo.dev/fugleramme](https://arnegiacomo.dev/fugleramme/)**

## Inspiration

The look came from a [WWF Verdens naturfond poster by Axel Thorenfeldt](https://www.axelthorenfeldt.com/news/wwf-verdens-naturfonds-fugleskole)
hanging on my wall, the live-frame idea from Teddy Warner's [AvianVisitors](https://theodore.net/projects/AvianVisitors/) that I saw on Instagram,
and the detection from [BirdNET-Go](https://github.com/tphakala/birdnet-go) - I wanted a version of that poster showing the actual birds in my garden.

## How it works

[BirdNET-Go](https://github.com/tphakala/birdnet-go) listens on a mic and identifies the
birds. Fugleramme polls its API, matches each species to an illustration, packs them onto a
page, and redraws only when the birds change - on an
[Inky Impression](https://shop.pimoroni.com/discount/ARNE?redirect=/products/inky-impression)
e-ink panel or any screen. An admin page lets you configure what to show, and the frame
updates itself.

If you already run BirdNET-Go, point the frame at it instead - on the same machine or anywhere else reachable from your network.

> [!TIP]
> The e-ink panel is what makes it a picture frame, but it isn't required. Without one, Fugleramme runs web-only
> and the page takes the shape of whatever shows it - a TV, an HDMI display, any device on the network, or even your
> desktop wallpaper/screensaver. See [Screens](docs/screens.md).

## Hardware

A Raspberry Pi 5, an [Inky Impression 13.3"](https://shop.pimoroni.com/discount/ARNE?redirect=/products/inky-impression)
(Spectra 6), a mic and an A4 frame. Full parts list, recommendations and alternatives: **[Hardware](docs/hardware.md)**.

I'm affiliated with Pimoroni - buying through the Pimoroni links or using the code `ARNE` at checkout supports this project.

## Art

Half the point of this project is showing off some amazing public-domain natural-history
illustrations. Over 1000 cut-outs covering more than 500 species, every one taken from a
real plate and hand-curated for this project (no art is AI-generated, though some has been
retouched with AI).

Each detected species is matched to its illustration, background-removed, and packed onto
a textured paper page with the larger birds toward the centre, sized by body mass. An empty
window shows a bare perch.

Coverage is best across Europe and northern Asia, good in North America, and thinner in the tropics and the southern hemisphere thus far - however, it's quickly growing!

[Species coverage](https://arnegiacomo.dev/fugleramme/species/) has a searchable list of all currently supported species (pick your location to see which of your local birds are supported). See [Adding artwork](docs/adding-artwork.md) for manual cutout steps.

## Install on a Raspberry Pi

From the pi (assuming you have the hardware up and running):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnegiacomo/fugleramme/main/install.sh | bash
```

Asks where BirdNET-Go should live and which ports to use, clones the repo, installs the required deps, and starts the frame as a systemd service. **NB!** Will probably require a reboot on a fresh system.

From a blank SD card, see the full [install guide](docs/install.md).

## Run in a container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v fugleramme:/data \
  -e FUGLERAMME_DETECTOR_URL=http://birdnet.local:8080 \
  ghcr.io/arnegiacomo/fugleramme
```

Kiosk on `:8080`, admin on `:8080/admin`, everything it persists in `/data`.

On a Linux box with a USB mic, this brings up BirdNET-Go alongside it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnegiacomo/fugleramme/main/examples/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

See **[Container](docs/container.md)** for more info.

## Run locally (for development)

```bash
uv sync                                       # set up venv
uv run fugleramme-fake-detector               # stand-in BirdNET-Go on :8090
uv run fugleramme-dev                         # start service on :8080 with hot-reload
```
